## Debugging Neovim

- Remember you can run nvim headless to poke around, view key mappings, etc.
- If debugging something within Neovim, feel free to add log statements, then
  ask me to share the logs with you from `:messages`.
- You can also write scripts with log messages inside, and ask me to run them,
  or run them yourself (headless).

Please DON'T include this. While I value your work, this adds needless noise.
